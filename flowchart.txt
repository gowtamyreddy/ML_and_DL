1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - Solar Power Forecast data
3. Feature Selection 
	- Selecting the X and y for pandas dataframe	
4. Visualization of Data based on SVR-PSO
5. Splitting the data to train and test
6. building the model
	1. Machine Learning
		- SVR - PSO
		- GA-SVR
		- SVR
		- GPR
		- Persistence with SVR
		- Voting Regression(LR + RFR + KNN)
		- Stacking Regression (RidgeCv + SVR + RFR)
	
	2. Deep Learning
		- ANN 
		- LSTM
7.training the model
8.building the model Voting Classifier since it gives better r2-score

Flask Framework
-----------------
9. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10. User gives input
11. the given input preprocessed and with trained model is used for predicting the performance 
12. final outcome is displayed


Extension
-----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned few Machine and Deep Learning models,in which SVR less MSE value,
As an extension we have applied Voting regression, stacking regression and LSTM for analysis Dataset, in which 
Voting Regression got 99% R2-Score,
So with Voting Regression we build the model is used for predicting the result with in the frontend.
